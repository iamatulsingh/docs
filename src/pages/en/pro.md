**Kubeshark** introduces a consumption-based pricing structure, offering initial complimentary capacity. Once this capacity is exceeded, charges are incurred based on the volume of API calls processed by **Kubeshark**. This model ensures that customers pay only for their actual usage, with costs directly tied to the amount of traffic handled by the system.

A single license can be used across any number of clusters without restriction to specific ones. The selected pricing tier may introduce limitations, such as on the number of nodes, API call capacity, and requirements for time and internet connectivity.

> An API call is defined as any protocol-level message captured, dissected, and reassembled by **Kubeshark**.

## COMMUNITY

The COMMUNITY edition is offered at no cost and supports clusters of up to two nodes without imposing any capacity limits or licensing requirements. Clusters that exceed two nodes are eligible for a complimentary PRO license, available upon sign up. The Complimentary PRO license includes 100,000 API calls per month at no cost.

Should additional capacity be necessary, please [reach out to us](https://kubeshark.co/contact-us).

> To get started with the COMMUNITY edition, [install **Kubeshark**](/en/install).
