**Kubeshark** can be used for free on clusters of any size with a few limitations.

## COMMUNITY (FREE)

The COMMUNITY edition is offered at no cost and supports clusters of up to two nodes without imposing any capacity limits or licensing requirements.

> To get started with the COMMUNITY edition, [install **Kubeshark**](/en/install).

## COMPLIMENTARY (FREE) PRO LICENSE

Clusters that exceed two nodes are eligible for a complimentary (free) PRO license, available upon sign-up. The complimentary PRO license includes 100,000 API calls, as a free trial, at no cost.

Should additional capacity be necessary, please [reach out to us](https://kubeshark.co/contact-us).

> To get started with the complimentary PRO edition on any size cluster, simply sign up using the dashboard.

## SINGLE-CLUSTER, UNLIMITED PRO LICENSE

The Single-Cluster Unlimited PRO plan is available on our website and supports clusters with up to 20 nodes. Additional plans, such as multi-cluster or on-demand options, are available upon request.

Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!

## ENTERPRISE   

Tailored for larger organizations managing multiple clusters, whether managed on their own or not, the Enterprise Edition features support for air-gapped environments and SAML/SSO integration.

Enterprise clients gain access to dedicated support services, including rapid assistance through Slack, on-demand Zoom calls, premium onboarding processes, and a commitment to ensuring smooth operations across all clusters.
