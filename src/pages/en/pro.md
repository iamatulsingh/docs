**Kubeshark** can be used for free on clusters of any size with a few limitations.

## COMMUNITY (FREE)

The COMMUNITY edition is offered at no cost and supports clusters of up to two nodes without imposing any capacity limits or licensing requirements.

> To get started with the COMMUNITY edition, [install **Kubeshark**](/en/install).

## COMPLIMENTARY (FREE) PRO LICENSE

Clusters that exceed two nodes are eligible for a complimentary (free) PRO license, available upon sign-up. The complimentary PRO license includes 100,000 API calls per month at no cost.

Should additional capacity be necessary, please [reach out to us](https://kubeshark.co/contact-us).

> To get started with the complimentary PRO edition on any size cluster, simply sign up using the dashboard.

## PRO 

The PRO plan supports an unlimited number of clusters, each with a maximum number of nodes. The minimum cost of the plan is determined according to the maximum number of nodes the plan should support, starting at $10 per node per month. The plan imposes a monthly API call processing limit based on spending tiers.

The PRO plan is highly flexible and enables users to decide their budget based on how busy their clusters are and how frequently they plan to use Kubeshark.

Our [pricing section](https://kubeshark.co/pricing#license-selection) includes a few ready-to-consume self-served plans. You can always start with the smallest plan and upgrade when necessary.

We also have options for unlimited usage plans at a fixed budget.

[Contact us](https://kubeshark.co/contact-us) to learn more about the available plans or request a plan that is tailored to your needs.

## ENTERPRISE   

Tailored for larger organizations managing multiple clusters, whether managed on their own or not, the Enterprise Edition features support for air-gapped environments and SAML/SSO integration.

Enterprise clients gain access to dedicated support services, including rapid assistance through Slack, on-demand Zoom calls, premium onboarding processes, and a commitment to ensuring smooth operations across all clusters.
