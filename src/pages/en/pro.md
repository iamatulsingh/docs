## PRO ON-DEMAND

**Most useful option for on-demand usage.**

- A single license is valid for unlimited nodes and clusters.
- Priced at $0.0001 per call, with billing typically occurring monthly or based on usage.
- Pricing is transparent, with no hidden charges or obligatory commitments.
- Users can use a credit card via [Stripe](https://console.kubeshark.co/?term=ON-DEMAND) or subscribe through an [AWS marketplace subscription](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-2pnxmkjuvsvs2).
- This tier necessitates an active internet connection.

Enterprise clients gain access to dedicated support services, including rapid assistance through Slack, on-demand Zoom calls, premium onboarding processes, and a commitment to ensuring smooth operations across all clusters.
