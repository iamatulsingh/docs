The helper [`vendor.webhook`](/en/automation_helpers#vendorwebhookmethod-string-url-string-body-string) enables uploading anything to anywhere as long as webhooks are supported. It does an HTTP request to the webhook (the HTTP endpoint) thatâ€™s defined by HTTP method and URL in the url argument with the HTTP body as the string in the body argument.

The following example calls a webhook for each health check:

```js
function onItemCaptured(data) {
  if (data.request.path === "/health")
    response = vendor.webhook(
      "POST",
      "https://webhook.site/a42ca96d-4984-45dc-8f72-a601448399dc",
      JSON.stringify(data),
      {
        "content-type": "application/json"
      }
    );
}
```

> See [`vendor.webhook`](/en/automation_helpers#vendorwebhookmethod-string-url-string-body-string) for more info.
