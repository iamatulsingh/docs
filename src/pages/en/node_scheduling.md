Node scheduling can be very beneficial when you want to control Kubeshark's resource consumption and limit its work to certain nodes at certain times.

For example, if you want to have Kubeshark installed and running in the cluster on a single node or on no nodes at all on idle, and unleash its power when nessasery.

We use K8s' [nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) as the mechanism and can set the various conditions in the  `nodeSelectorTerms` Kubeshark config property.

## Using the CLI
When we set this example in `~/.kubeshark/config.yaml`:

```shell
tap:
  nodeSelectorTerms:
  - matchExpressions:
      - key: kubeshark-active
        operator: In
        values:
          - 'true'
```

We can use the following `kubectl` sequence to schedule and unschedule certain nodes:
```shell
> kubectl get nodes
NAME                                                    STATUS   ROLES    AGE   
ip-192-168-77-217.us-east-2.compute.internal            Ready    <none>   3d15h   

> kubectl label nodes ip-192-168-77-217.us-east-2.compute.internal kubeshark-active=false --overwrite
> kubectl label nodes ip-192-168-77-217.us-east-2.compute.internal kubeshark-active==true --overwrite
```

In the above example, when a node is labeled with `kubeshark-active=false` the worker's DaemonSet pod will not run and vice versa.

## Using Helm

Use the following option when you install Kubeshark with Helm:

```shell
helm install kubeshark kubeshark/kubeshark  \
--set-json 'tap.nodeSelectorTerms=[{"matchExpressions": [ {"key":"kubeshark-active", "operator": "In", "values": ["true" ] } ] }]'
```
